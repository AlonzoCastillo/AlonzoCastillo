- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlonzoCastillo a Jr.Developer in the works. 
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end and back-end development. Call me the AL-of all trades if you will. I have been developing for 1 year now and I have learned so much in a short amount of time. From Web-development, Python, Java, and now MERN. It is definitely still a learning curve and I aim to be the best in what I do.  
- 🌱 I have graduated from Coding Dojo with a full-stack developer certificate. With the projects I have created I reallyl put my own skills to the test. Are they something I am proud of? The answer is yes! Do they still need some touch ups and a little bit of work, absolutely!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that relate to both business start ups or fitness type content. 
- 📫 How to reach me: my personal email: accast3@gmail.com

AlonzoCastillo/AlonzoCastillo is a repsository that can display both my skills and creativity for certain projects. I tend to keep things as simple as I can while making them look appealing to the eye. If theres anything I have learned from my career is that presentation is everything and the backend is the foundation to anything you create.
