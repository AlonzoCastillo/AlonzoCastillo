- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlonzoCastillo a Jr.Developer in the works. 
- I am a full-stack developer with a passion for building efficient and user-friendly applications. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript (MERN stack). I am well-versed in web development frameworks such as Flask and Spring, and have a strong understanding of React and Node.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I have hands-on experience in using databases such as MongoDB and MySQL Workbench and I am always keen to learn new technologies. My goal is to create scalable, maintainable, and secure systems that provide a seamless experience for end-users. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of the projects I've been working on and let's build something great together.
